# Contributor <br class="ignore-sp">Guidelines for Conduct


<div align="right" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
  See <a href="/ja/code-of-conduct">Japanese version</a>
</div>

The following guidelines for conduct are applied to all repositories published from [our GitHub organization (@YassLab)](https://github.com/YassLab), including all collaborative spaces, such as mailing lists, submitted patches, commit comments:

- Participants are expected to be tolerant of opposing views.
- Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
- Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

These can be updated, and if then, it will be notified from this page. If you have any question on these guidelines, feel free to ask us via the [contact form](#contact) on the bottom of this page.
