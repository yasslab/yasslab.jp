## Skills

- Ruby / Rails
- Git / GitHub
- RSpec / Turnip
- Heroku / Circle CI
- Continuous Integration
- Agile Web Development

We are familiar with backend technologies, especially Ruby and Rails, but also we have skills in frontend like JavaScript, jQuery, Vuejs. 

## Contract Style we suggest

We recommend to have a short-term contract first, and renew it if you think we provide value with your project.

To embody the contract style above, we generally sign two contract, Basic and Order, which includes:

- Basic contract clarifies NDA, delegating rights of our code, etc.
- Order contract clarifies how many months we support to develop
- Under the Basic contract, you can renew Order contract anytime

The point is that you can renew Order contract anytime **if we have resources.** For example, if our clients renew and reserve our resources in advance, you cannot renew unless we have resources to support.


## Price we offer

Our basic price is **1,000,000 yen/month.**

- Available time: **10:00〜19:00 (JST)**
	- The time includes break time and writing monthly reports.
- Splitting the time into 1day/week or 3days/week are available.
	- The price above is for **5days/week** to support.
- We **remotely** support your project.
	- We recommend to have an online meeting regularly.
	- The meeting lessens the gap between expectation and actual outcome.
